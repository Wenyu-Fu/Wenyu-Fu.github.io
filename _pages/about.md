### My Research Interests

I am currently focused on exploring the following areas where I aim to combine my passion for **bioinformatics**, **machine learning**, and **animal science**:

#### **Bioinformatics**
I am particularly fascinated by the application of **computational methods** to analyze biological data. Specifically, my interests lie in **single-cell genomics** and **microbiome analysis**, where I believe we can uncover novel insights into **animal health**, **disease mechanisms**, and **ecological balance** through the analysis of complex, multi-dimensional data.

#### **Machine Learning**
I am also excited about the potential of **machine learning** in biological research. By applying machine learning algorithms to large-scale genomic and omics datasets, I aim to identify hidden patterns and predict new biological phenomena that could lead to more effective **biotechnological applications**.

Through these interdisciplinary fields, I aspire to contribute to advancements in **biotechnology**, **precision medicine**, and **sustainable animal science**, with a particular focus on how data-driven insights can be used to improve animal health and welfare.
