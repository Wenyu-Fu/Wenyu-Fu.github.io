<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
我属于英语从小不好的那种。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
还记得小学的时候就很怕英语，也很怕英语老师。究其原因，应该还是因为我太懒了，而且没有参加课外辅导。老师说，英语不像是数学语文，数学靠天赋，语文靠平时生活的耳濡目染。英语只靠日复一日无聊的背诵，自然是谁花的时间多谁就能学的好。而对于我，花的时间又少，对英语也不感兴趣，只能说能到班级的平均分。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
有一次，英语老师布置了一份英语作业——在电脑上跟读。然而，我很懒，也不喜欢读英语，磨磨蹭蹭打开了爸爸的电脑，发现电脑音响好像坏了，根本放不出声音，那更没办法跟读了。然后我高高兴兴的告诉爸爸我做不了作业了。爸爸说，好吧，一时半会儿也修不好，那就别做了。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
第二天，上英语课。英语老师抽查跟读作业，方法就是叫同学站起来朗读，读得不好就是说明没认真学。我心中忐忑不安，生怕叫到了我。然而，不知道是不是我与老师对视了，还是老师看出了我的紧张不安，就叫我起来回答。我看着书上扭七扭八的单词，只觉得天旋地转。喉咙里吱吱呀呀的仿佛卡着什么，发不出声音。我无助的抬起头，望着老师逐渐扭曲的脸。她问我，是不是没跟读？！我说是的，因为家里电脑坏了，没有声音，老师让我坐下，余怒绕梁。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
一个星期过去了，老师再一次布置了跟读作业，然而爸爸这次还是没去修电脑，我又没办法跟读了。这次我是真想跟读，但是电脑拿去修了，应该也没有这么快修好。于是又只好放弃。第二天去学校，老师和我心有灵犀一般，又抽到了我，有了第一次的经验，我显然没有那么紧张了。我镇定下来，决定破釜沉舟。我开始读单词，前几个都是我会的，我松了一口气，卡卡顿顿继续往下读。生词很快就出现了，对于小学生来说，没掌握词根词缀，也不懂自然拼读，就算是我努力想读对，也是无济于事。老师终于又还是发现了，她的脸又开始扭曲起来，这次她没有让我坐下，而是让我罚站。我解释说，家里电脑还没修好。然而老师却居高临下：“说一次的谎言，说两次就不会让人相信了。”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
小学五年级的时候，表姐从美国大学毕业了，姑姑和爷爷去参加毕业典礼。爸妈让我也去见见世面，也不管我还在上课，请了两个星期的假就去美国了。从美国回来，英语老师问我，去美国学了两个星期，有没有学会什么单词？我极力回想了一下，好像有一个单词在我脑袋里跳跃。我说有的，学会了一个。老师追问，什么单词。我有些紧张，那个单词也似乎有些紧张，在我脑子里躲起来，我茫然的停顿了一两秒。老师抓住机会，哈哈大笑，花了几万就学会一个单词？还没记住？全班哗然。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
熬过小学，上了初中，英语还是一如既往的差。有一次月考结束，英语老师拿着成绩单语重心长问我说，为什么英语会这么差，如果英语考的和czk（全校第一）一样高，你都能超过他了。我感觉很对不起这个老师，因为我还是很喜欢这个英语老师的。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
上了高中，去了一所外国语学校，我越来越感觉我的英语跟不上其他同学了。有一次英语朗读比赛，我们小组读完后匿名选票中出现了一个全场最低分，6分。那个同学也丝毫没藏着掖着，直言就是她打的低分，她说她一听到我的英语口音就给我们组打了6分。她不知道的是，我觉得我应该是全班准备得最认真的同学，我认真听了我每个要读的句子，标上音调的升降，标上重读的单词，甚至是字母。然而结果还是让我失望，我还是拖累了我的组员。从那时起，我暗暗下定决心，我要努力学英语，然后惊艳所有人。我发奋努力，老师给的每一篇范文，我都抄在本子上，反复读背，直到滚瓜烂熟。在高考前的模拟考，我考到了全校第一，英语老师向我妈发去了祝贺，我妈在朋友圈了也晒了英语成绩。导致现在还有些我妈的朋友误以为我的英语很好。其实我知道这百分之九十九是运气。果不其然，我高考英语就考了119分，确实是惊了所有人。不是惊艳而是惊吓。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
高考结束那天，我妈和我去英语老师的办公室送花。老师问我考的怎么样，这次高考英语简单了吧。我其实心理已经有了不好的预感，但也附和道，还好吧。老师说大概能考几分？我说应该有一百二十几。老师哈哈大笑，这么谦虚，一百三肯定有的，谁谁谁都说他应该有一百三，我也跟着笑了笑。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
高考出分那天，我看着英语119陷入了沉思。付出就有回报吗？当然不是。那我为什么还这么悲伤，这不就是个概率事件吗？就算不认真学也能考好，就算在认真也可能考砸。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
上大学后，我再也不想好好学习了。我以为学了这么多年英语，终于可以摆烂了。没想到大学还有大学英语课，还有两个学期要上，分别是大学英语3和大学英语4。我想，别挂科就行，于是开始摆烂式上课，只出勤，不出脑子。一个学期学下来，甚至不知道期末考试要考什么。有一些题是考书本上单词的默写和意思，但是我完全没有背过，痛失三四十分。最后成绩出来了，喜提了2.7超低绩点，我的英语成绩击败了全校15%的同学。但想想也无所谓，反正我未来也不一定读研究生，混个毕业不就行了。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
然而大学读着读着，接触到的信息越来越多，人和思想也逐渐成熟起来，萌生了出国读研的想法，那就只能开始卷绩点了！</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
有出国的想法是在大一下，当时刚上完了大英3，大英4就上了一节课，我果断选择退掉大英4，后面发现这是一个很明知的决定，因为我觉得我的英语还需要积累。其实大一下，大二，大三上我并没有特意去学英语，只是阅读了一些文献，写了一篇sci论文。就算是这样，我的英语也有了些许的进步，于是在大三下的时候，我重新选了大英4开始学英语。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
上第一节课，我就能明显感觉到我的进步很大。老师上课时问的一些问题似乎没那么难，但是就是有一部分同学回答不出来，这给了我很大的自信。当然，我也并不是说我在班里就名列前茅了，还是有很多大佬强的没边。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
好在经过大学三年的摸爬滚打，我逐渐掌握了得高分的诀窍。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
首先就是要搞清楚考核的内容。考核一般分为平时成绩和期末考试成绩两部分。平时成绩包括平时出勤，作业，小测，口语等等的分数，期末考试考一部分课内一部分课外的英语知识。两个部分各占总成绩的百分之五十。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
搞清楚后就是有针对性的准备，平时成绩里占大头的是小测，那么就得搞清楚小测什么时候考，考试的内容是什么。我们小测考试主要考的是课内的单词的理解和默写，还有课外的听力，还有一篇作文。对于课外的听力和作文其实很难准备，这个还得看积累，但是对于单词就很好复习。我一般会先确定小测的时间，然后提前一周开始准备，由于一次小测考四个单元，我都先花四天时间，每天背一个单元，再花两天时间混起来背并默写，最后一天把错过的单词抄下来多看几遍，考前也可以再看一篇，利用瞬时记忆速记。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
其实每个人的复习节奏各不相同，也可以按照自己的节奏来，记忆力比较好的两三天也可以速记下来。我不知道有没有人的记忆和我一样，要我突然去记住一个东西很难，但是我喜欢每天看一点，看多了记不住。但是看的那一点睡了一觉过后就突然记得很牢，第二天起床甚至比第一天记得还清楚。所以我选择了适合我的记忆方法，就是一天看一点，但是得把战线拉长。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
除了小测，最重要的就是口语。口语要想得高分很看实力，不太可能速成口语。想要速成只能另辟蹊径，由于负责考口语和负责教学的老师并不是同一个人，所以重中之重是让新老师对你有好的印象。在考口语的那天，我早早就来到了教室，可以给老师一个准时并且重视这场考试的印象。如果不社恐，甚至可以和老师聊两句，加深对彼此的熟悉度。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
到回答问题的阶段，对于口语不太好的我来说，正常的表达都已经让我力不从心了，更是难以提出什么真知灼见。既然不能回答的比别人好，不如放手一搏，直接举手第一个回答，显得好像很自信，无形之中先装一波，让老师以为你的英语很厉害。给老师植入这个先入为主的观点之后就更容易得高分，这是心理学的一个什么效应有点忘记了。对于后面的回答来说，尽量回答的长一点，停顿少一点，但是这也很难做到，有时候这两点也是互斥的，只能说尽力就好。最后，其实我感觉我们那组的水平都差不多，但是我得了8.5分，另外4个人都得了8分。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
最后是重头大戏——期末考试。题型和小测差不多，但是课外内容比小测更多一点。但是课外内容再多你也准备不到啊，所以对于期末考试，我采用了与小测类似的复习方法，背课内单词。不同的是，这次我更加关注每个单词的例句，这一方面可以加深对单词的理解，另一方面也可以恢复阅读的语感，为期末阅读题做准备。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
按照这一套复习方式，最后我的大英4拿了4.2绩点，虽然说没有大佬一样高。但是重在进步大，效率高，适合英语基础不太好的宝宝使用。</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-family: 'FangSong';">
我和英语未来的路还很长，希望能借力保持住这份热情，学好一门外语确实很难，大家一起加油吧！

## English version

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
I’ve never been good at English since I was a child.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
I still remember how I was afraid of English, and even more afraid of English teachers, back in elementary school. The root cause, I think, was my laziness and the fact that I didn’t attend any extracurricular tutoring. Our teacher once said that English is different from subjects like math and Chinese—math depends on talent, Chinese relies on everyday exposure, but English requires boring, day-in and day-out memorization. The more time you spend, the better you get. But I didn’t spend enough time and wasn’t interested in English, so at best, I only hovered around the class average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Once, our English teacher assigned us a speaking assignment—we were supposed to read along on the computer. But I was lazy and disliked reading English out loud, so I dragged my feet and finally opened my dad’s computer, only to find that the speakers weren’t working. There was no sound, which meant I couldn’t follow along. I happily told my dad that I couldn’t do the homework. He said, “Well, if it’s broken and can’t be fixed immediately, then just don’t do it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
The next day in English class, the teacher randomly called on students to read aloud as a way to check if we had practiced. Those who read poorly were assumed to have slacked off. I was nervous, hoping desperately not to be called. But perhaps the teacher saw the fear on my face, or maybe we made eye contact—I was chosen. I looked at the unfamiliar words in the textbook and felt like the world was spinning. My throat tightened; I could barely make a sound. I looked up helplessly, only to see the teacher’s face twist with anger. She asked, “You didn’t do the reading practice, did you?!” I said no, explaining that the computer at home was broken and there was no sound. She let me sit down, but the anger lingered in the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
A week later, we got the same assignment. My dad still hadn’t fixed the computer, and I couldn’t practice. This time, I truly wanted to complete the task, but the computer hadn’t been repaired, so I had no choice but to give up again. Sure enough, the teacher called on me again in class. Having gone through it once, I wasn’t as nervous. I composed myself and decided to go all in. I started reading the words. The first few I knew, which gave me confidence. But soon, I ran into unfamiliar vocabulary. As a kid, I had no knowledge of roots, suffixes, or phonics, so no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t read them correctly. The teacher noticed. Her face twisted again—not in disappointment, but in anger. She didn’t let me sit down this time; instead, she made me stand. I explained again about the broken computer. But she stood above me and said coldly, “A lie told once might be believed. Tell it twice, and no one will trust you.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
In fifth grade, my cousin graduated from a university in the U.S. My aunt and grandpa went to attend the ceremony. My parents thought it’d be a good experience for me, so they took me along—even though I was still in school. I took a two-week leave to go to the U.S. After returning, my English teacher asked, “Did you learn any words during your time in America?” I racked my brain. I thought there was one word floating in my head. I said yes, I learned one. She pressed me: “What word?” I got nervous. That word got nervous too and disappeared from my mind. I paused for a couple of seconds. She laughed. “You spent tens of thousands of yuan to learn just one word? And you can’t even remember it?” The whole class burst into laughter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
I made it through elementary school and into middle school, but my English didn’t improve. After one monthly exam, my English teacher looked at my scores and asked seriously, “Why is your English so poor? If your English were as good as CZK’s (the top student in the whole school), you’d beat him overall.” I felt guilty—I actually liked this English teacher a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
In high school, I got into a foreign language school and began to realize how far behind I was. One time, we had a group English reading contest. After we performed, there was an anonymous voting process. The lowest score was 6 out of 10. A classmate openly said she gave us that score. “As soon as I heard your accent, I gave your group a 6,” she said bluntly. What she didn’t know was that I had probably prepared the most out of anyone in class. I had listened to the recordings of every sentence, marked intonation patterns, highlighted stressed words—even individual letters. But the result was still disappointing. I dragged down the whole group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
At that moment, I made a silent vow: I would work hard and one day surprise everyone with my English. I studied hard. Every model essay the teacher gave us, I copied into a notebook and memorized it by heart. Before the college entrance exam, in one mock test, I scored first in the entire school. My English teacher congratulated my mom, who proudly shared my English score on WeChat. To this day, some of her friends still mistakenly think I’m great at English. But I know—99% of that was luck. Sure enough, on the actual college entrance exam, I scored only 119. I did surprise everyone—not with brilliance, but with shock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
On the day of the exam, my mom and I went to my English teacher’s office to give her flowers. She asked how the test went. “The English section seemed easy, right?” I already had a bad feeling, but I nodded and said, “It was okay.” She asked, “How many points do you think you’ll get?” I said, “Probably in the 120s.” She laughed. “So humble! You must’ve scored 130 at least! Even so-and-so said he probably got 130!” I smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
When the scores came out and I saw the 119, I fell into deep thought. Does hard work always pay off? Of course not. But then why did I feel so sad? Wasn’t this just a probability game? Some people do well without trying; others fail even when they’ve worked hard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
After entering college, I didn’t want to study anymore. I thought I could finally slack off after years of struggling with English. But to my surprise, we still had to take two semesters of College English—College English 3 and 4. I figured I just needed to pass, so I attended class without much effort. By the end of the semester, I didn’t even know what the final exam would test. Some sections involved dictation and vocabulary definitions from the textbook, but I hadn’t studied them. I lost 30–40 points just like that. In the end, I scored a dismal 2.7 GPA, better than 15% of my classmates. I thought it didn’t matter—after all, I didn’t plan to go to grad school. I just needed to graduate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
But as college went on, I was exposed to more information. I matured. I began to consider studying abroad for a master’s degree. That meant I had to start caring about my GPA again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
I first had the idea to study abroad in my freshman year, after I’d finished College English 3 and started College English 4. I quickly dropped College English 4 after one class, realizing my English still needed work. Honestly, from the second half of my freshman year through junior year, I didn’t deliberately study English. I just read some academic papers and wrote an SCI article. Still, my English improved. So, in the second semester of my junior year, I re-enrolled in College English 4.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
From the very first class, I could feel how much I had improved. The questions the teacher asked no longer seemed as difficult, and some students even struggled with ones I could answer. This gave me confidence. Of course, I’m not saying I was the top student—far from it. There were still many incredibly strong classmates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Thankfully, after three years of trial and error, I gradually figured out how to get high scores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
The first step is understanding how you’ll be assessed. Grades are usually split into two parts: daily performance and final exam. Daily performance includes attendance, homework, quizzes, and speaking. The final combines in-class and out-of-class content. Each part accounts for 50% of the total grade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Once you know what to expect, prepare accordingly. In our case, quizzes made up the largest portion of daily performance. They tested vocabulary comprehension and spelling, listening from outside materials, and a short essay. The listening and writing parts are harder to prepare for and depend on your overall ability. But vocabulary is easier to study. I’d check the quiz dates in advance and start preparing a week ahead. Since each quiz covered four units, I’d study one per day for four days, then spend two days reviewing all four together, and use the last day to focus on the words I struggled with. I’d also review again right before the quiz for short-term memory recall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Everyone has a different learning pace. Personally, I struggle with cramming—I find it hard to memorize things suddenly. But if I go over small portions daily, I remember them more clearly the next day, especially after a good night’s sleep. So, I spread out my study schedule and used that to my advantage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Besides quizzes, speaking was the most important part. High scores in speaking are hard to “cram” for, so I took a different approach. The teacher grading speaking was not the same as the one teaching the class, so it was crucial to leave a good impression. On the day of the speaking test, I arrived early to show my seriousness. If you’re not shy, even making small talk with the teacher helps build rapport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
When it came time to answer questions, I knew my spoken English wasn’t strong enough to give brilliant answers. So instead, I volunteered to speak first, hoping to appear confident. This created a strong first impression—some kind of psychological effect, though I forget the name. I tried to speak as fluently and as long as possible, minimizing pauses. It wasn’t easy, but I did my best. In the end, although everyone in my group was about the same level, I got an 8.5, while the others scored 8.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Lastly, the final exam. The format was similar to the quiz, but with more outside content. Since I couldn’t prepare for that part, I focused on textbook vocabulary again. This time, I paid more attention to the example sentences. It helped deepen my understanding and improve my reading flow for the exam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
Following this method, I ended up with a 4.2 GPA in College English 4. It wasn’t top-tier, but the improvement was huge, and it was efficient—perfect for students with a weak English foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
The road between me and English is still long, but I hope I can maintain this enthusiasm. Learning a foreign language is hard, but let’s all keep going together!</p>
