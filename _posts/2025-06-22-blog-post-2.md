## Project Overview

This project aims to uncover the gene expression landscape of the pig jejunum through single-cell RNA sequencing. By analyzing and visualizing the data, we aim to explore the diversity of cell types and their biological functions within the jejunal tissue. This research provides insights into gut immunity and metabolism, contributing to a deeper understanding of the role of the intestine in health and disease.

Using single-cell RNA-seq data, we have created a comprehensive map of the cell populations within the jejunum, providing valuable information for further research into gut-related disorders and diseases in pigs.

## Key Features

- **Data Source**: Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the pig jejunum.
- **Analysis Tools**: Utilizes cutting-edge single-cell RNA analysis tools like Seurat and Scanpy.
- **Visualization**: UMAP, t-SNE, and other methods are used to visualize the distribution of cell populations.
- **Multimodal Integration**: Integrates gene expression data with other biological markers to enhance understanding of cellular diversity.
